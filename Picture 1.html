  I think the abstract colors are really interesting and the bright contrasting colors create a really striking composition. I chose this photo because I wanted to use something with basic color and without any figures or main structures that you would find in basic life. This is a close up picture of a painting I saw at a muesum, I heavily edited the colors of it in Photoshop in order to transform the imadge into something diffrent from the orignal painting. I really like abstract art and I think this is a good example of abstract art through a photograph.
