   I think the lighting composition around the silhouette of the central figure in the portrait creates a unique image and the sun in the background behind it adds to the composition. I like the photo alot, I took it near a bridge by a pier, I think the main figure in the picture can be interpreted in alot of diffrent ways but I think it is clear he is looking at the direction of the camera/viewer, even though his face is completly abstraced from the picture, his posture tells enough to indicate what his face is looking at. I think the background is also really beautiful, and the heavy use of bright colors makes the piece more abstract and striking.
